determine precidence based on frequency of keywords used in the HTML document. 
Each page simply contains one keyword or combination of keywords 
which should bring the page to #1 in most search engines :)
To add more keywords, simply make a duplicate of this page, 
replace the keyword, and then name the page "keyword".html
You can then submit the page manually to various search engines 
or simply be patient and wait 3 or 4 weeks for the web crawlers 
to pick it up. If somebody can come up with a script that will 
automatically submit the page to various search engines, 
that would be hella nifty too :) -->

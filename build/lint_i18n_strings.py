"""An i18n linting tool for exercises.

Catches common i18n problems in exercises and recommends solutions to
fix them. Wherever possible the script can also automatically fix the
problems with limited user interaction.

By default the script acts as a linter outputting errors that must be
corrected by hand and a list of any errors that could be fixed
automatically (which is still considered to be a linting failure).

If run with the --fix flag then the script will automatically fix the
files in place wherever possible. The user will be prompted to clear
up any ambiguities as well.

    """Fix usage of plural() in exercises.

    This filter fixes a number of different issues relating to the usage of
    plural() in exercises. An interactive prompt is used to clear up any
    information that can't be resolved automatically.

    To start with it fixes the usage of two plural signatures.
    The signature: <var>plural(STRING, NUM)</var> is pretty much left intact.

    For example given the following string:
        <p>I ran <var>NUM</var> <var>plural(distance(1), NUM)</var>.</p>
    It will generate the following two strings:
        <p data-if="isSingular(NUM)">I ran <var>NUM</var>
            <var>distance(1)</var>.</p>
        <p data-else>I ran <var>NUM</var>
            <var>plural_form(distance(1), NUM)</var>.</p>

    And given the following string:
        <p>I ran <var>NUM</var> <var>plural(NUM, distance(1))</var>.</p>
    It will generate the following two strings:
        <p data-if="isSingular(NUM)">I ran <var>NUM</var>
            <var>distance(1)</var>.</p>
        <p data-else>I ran <var>NUM</var>
            <var>plural_form(distance(1), NUM)</var>.</p>

    (Note that the signature `plural(NUM, STRING)` outputs the number in
    addition to the string itself.)

    The tricky part about this ambiguous method signature is in figuring
    out the different cases and how to resolve them. Let's step through each
    possible case to show you how it's done.

    The easiest case is when one of the arguments to the plural() function
    is a string.

    For example given the following string:
        <p>I ran <var>plural(NUM, "mile")</var>.</p>
    It will generate the following two strings:
        <p data-if="isSingular(NUM)">I ran 1 mile.</p>
        <p data-else>I ran <var>NUM</var> miles.</p>

    The pluralization of the static string is done by prompting the user
    for the correct plural form of the word.

    The second most common case is in using one of the built-in string methods
    such as `distance(POS)`, `item(POS)`, or `clothing(POS)`. We look for all
    of these possible signatures and if one exists then we assume that that
    is the string argument. The output will be the same as one of the above
    examples.

    The final case is when the arguments are truly ambiguous: When there is
    no obvious way to detect if one argument is a string and one is a number.
    We fix this by prompting the user for help in determining which argument
    holds the number. With this information we can then easily resolve the
    output (in a form similar to the handling of the built-in methods).

    We do this so that we can mark up the string with a large warning function
    call like AMBIGUOUS_PLURAL and report an error to the user.

    This case of ambiguity is knowing if the text contents of a text argument
    is able to be pluralized, or not. Right now the only case where this is
    true is for the built-in string functions, like item(1). Pretty much
    anything else fails this case. I should mention that it's totally possible
    that the dev has marked the string up to be pluralizable but we just can't
    determine that from our analysis here. The only way we can determine this
    is to explicitly require the dev to rewrite the function signature to
    something else. This is why the function call is mutated into the obvious
    AMBIGUOUS_PLURAL and requires that the user manually convert it into the
    form plural_form(TEXT_VAR, NUM_VAR). It's assumed that anything using the
    plural_form() function is in fact pluralizable (if it's not that call is
    going to generate an error to the console).

    For example given the expression:
        <var>plural(ITEM, NUM)</var>

    We've already determined that the first argument, ITEM, holds a string via
    _check_plural_arg_is_num. However we DON'T know if the argument has been
    properly marked up using the new `new Plural()` utility. Because of this
    we want to return False for any any string arguments that we don't care
    about marking up (namely string literals and the built-in functions, which
    are already marked up) and return True for everything else (which will
    likely be variables or user-defined function calls that hold strings).

    This will allow us to convert the above expression into the following at a
    later time:
        <var>AMBIGUOUS_PLURAL(ITEM, NUM)</var>

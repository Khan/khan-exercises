				<div class="hints">
					<p>We’re trying to figure out how many home runs <var>person( 1 )</var> needs to hit in the remaining games this season to reach <var>his( 1 )</var> goal.</p>
					<p>The number of home runs <var>person( 1 )</var> has hit so far + the number of home runs <var>person( 1 )</var> will hit in the remaining games = the total home runs <var>person( 1 )</var> will hit this season.</p>
					<p>We can replace the words in the equation we just wrote with the numbers we have. Let’s use r to represent the remaining runs <var>person( 1 )</var> needs to hit. <var>X</var> + r = <var>Q</var></p>
					<p>We need to isolate r to figure out its value, so let’s subtract the number of runs <var>person( 1 )</var> has already hit from both sides. <var>X</var> + r - <var>X</var> = <var>Q</var> - <var>X</var></p>

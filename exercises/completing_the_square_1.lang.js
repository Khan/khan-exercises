		"hint2"		: 'We complete the square by taking half of the coefficient of our <code>x</code> term, squaring it, and adding it to both sides of the equation. Since the coefficient of our <code>x</code> term is <code><var>B</code></var>, half of it would be <code><var>B / 2</var></code>, and squaring it gives us <code>\color{blue}{<var>pow( B / 2, 2 )</var>}</code>.',
		"hint3"		: 'We can now rewrite the left side of the equation as a squared term.',
		"hint4"		: 'The left side of the equation is already a perfect square trinomial. The coefficient of our <code>x</code> term is <code><var>B</code></var>, half of it is <code><var>B / 2</var></code>, and squaring it gives us <code>\color{blue}{<var>pow( B / 2, 2 )</var>}</code>, our constant term.',
		"hint5"		: 'Thus, we can rewrite the left side of the equation as a squared term.',
		"hint6"		: 'Take the square root of both sides.',

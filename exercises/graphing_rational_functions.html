                        <p>
                            (1) Let's start with the x-intercept.  The x-intercept is the place
                            where the graph crosses the x-axis.  Therefore the y value of the
                            point has to be zero.  In other words, the point is (?, 0).
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            How do we figure out the x coordinate?  Well, we need to figure
                            out what x would have to be in order to make y -- or
                            f(x) -- equal to zero.  We could try to guess and check.
                            For instance, if we try plugging in x = 5, what would y equal?
                            Well f(5) = <var>FNX_NOHOLE(5)</var>, which is not zero.  But
                            this isn't very efficient.  So let's try factoring the
                            numerator.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            When you factor the numerator, you find that <var>NUMERATOR_TEXT</var>
                            can be rewritten as (<var>FACTOR1_TEXT</var>)(<var>FACTOR2_TEXT</var>). Now
                            if either (<var>FACTOR1_TEXT</var>) or (<var>FACTOR2_TEXT</var>) equalled
                            zero, the numerator would equal zero, and this happens when x=<var>NEG_ZERO</var> 
                            or when x = <var>NEG_HOLE</var>.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            But we have to be careful, and factor the denominator first.  Doing that,
                            we find that <var>DENOMINATOR_TEXT</var>can be rewritten as (<var>FACTOR3_TEXT</var>)
                            (<var>FACTOR2_TEXT</var>).  That's interesting, because now the numerator and
                            the denominator are both zero when x equals <var>NEG_HOLE</var>, making f(x) undefined
                        	there. We'll put that off momentarily.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            What is clear is that when x equals <var>NEG_ZERO</var>, the numerator 
                            is equal to zero, but the denominator is not, so f(<var>NEG_ZERO</var>)=0.  That
                            is exactly what we are looking for!
                            
                        </p>
                	</div>
                	
                	<div>
                		<p>
                			(2) Now let's look at what happens when x = <var>NEG_ASYM</var>. The denominator
                			is now equal to zero, but the numerator is not, and so f(x) is undefined
                			at this x coordinate.  OK.  What about when x is a tiny bit larger than 
                			<var>NEG_ASYM</var>?  Well the denominator would then be a really really
                			small positive number.  What would y =?  Well, dividing a positive value
                			in the numerator by a tiny positive value in the denominator makes y a very
                			large positive value.  A similar analysis can be done for values of x that are
                			a tiny bit smaller than <var>NEG_ASYM</var>.  The denominator would be a really
                			really small negative number, so y would be a really large negative number.
                			In other words, we have a vertical asymptote at x = <var>NEG_ASYM</var>
                		</p>
                	</div>
                	<div>
                		<p>
                			(3) Finally, let's tackle the x value of <var>NEG_HOLE</var>.  First, let's
                			plug into f(x) any value of x that is not equal to <var>NEG_HOLE</var>.  Say, 
                			x = 5 again.  Notice how we are plugging 5 into <var>FACTOR2_TEXT</var> both
                			in the numerator and the denominator.  Those two values will cancel out!
                			So the y value for f(5) can be found by plugging x=5 into a new function: 
                			(<var>FACTOR1_TEXT</var>)/(<var>FACTOR3_TEXT</var>).  This function clearly has
                			one zero and one vertical asymptote.  But f(x) is exactly the same, except
                			for when x = <var>NEG_HOLE</var>!  So f(x) looks exactly like 
                			(<var>FACTOR1_TEXT</var>)/(<var>FACTOR3_TEXT</var>) except that there is a hole in 
                			f(x) where the y value would have been.
                			
                			<br>
                			<br>
                			How do we find the x and y coordinates of that hole? The x coordinate we know -
                			it is the x value that is making the numerator and the denominator equal
                			to zero, which is x = <var>NEG_HOLE</var>.  We can't find the y value
                			just by plugging <var>NEG_HOLE</var> into f(x), since it is undefined.  But
                			we can plug <var>NEG_HOLE</var> into our new function (<var>FACTOR1_TEXT</var>)/(<var>FACTOR3_TEXT</var>)
                			to find where the y value is there.  Plugging that in, we find that the
                			y value is <var>FNX_NOHOLE(NEG_HOLE)</var>.  But f(x) is identical everywhere
                			except for at x = <var>NEG_HOLE</var>, so that point in the new function
                			becomes a hole in f(x).

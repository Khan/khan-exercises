                <p class="solution" data-forms="integer"><var>ANSWER</var></p>
                <div class="hints">
                    <div>
                        Let's try building the re-arrangements (or permutations) letter by letter. The word is <var>WORD.length</var>
                        letters long, so there are <var>WORD.length</var> blank spaces to put letters.
                        <p><var>_.map(_.range(WORD.length), function(l){ return "_ "; }).join("")</var></p>
                        <p>Now, for the first blank, we have <var>WORD.length</var> choices of letters to put in.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        After we put in the first letter, let's say it's <var>PERM[0]</var>, we have <var>WORD.length-1</var> blanks left.
                        <p><var>PERM[0]+" "+_.map(_.range(WORD.length-1), function(l){ return "_ "; }).join("")</var></p>
                        <p>For the second blank, we only have <var>WORD.length-1</var> choices of letters left to put in. So far, there were
                            <code><var>WORD.length</var>*<var>WORD.length-1</var></code> unique choices we could have made.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        We can continue in this fashion to put in a third letter, then a fourth, and so on. At each step, we have one fewer unique choice to
                        make, until we get to the last letter, and there's only one we can put in.
                    </br></br>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        Using this method, the total number of unique arrangements is <code><var>_.map(_.range(WORD.length).reverse(), function(l){ return (++l) + "*";}).join("").substring(0, WORD.length*2-1)</var> = <var>ANSWER</var>.</code> Another way of writing this is <code><var>WORD.length</var>!</code>, 
                        or <var>WORD.length</var> factorial, but this isn't quite the right answer.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        Using the above method, we assumed that all the letters were unique. But they're not! There are <var>REPTIMES</var>
                        <var>REPLETTER</var>s, so we're counting every permutation multiple times. Instead of this:
                            <p>
                                <var>PERM_UNIQUE</var>
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        We need to divide the number of permutations we got by the number of times we're overcounting each permutation.
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="reindeer">

                    <var id="NAMES">randFromArray([["Bloopin", "Gloopin", "Prancer", "Lancer", "Quentin"],["Balthazar", "Ezekiel", "Orrin", "Rudy"]])</var>

                <p>You need to put your reindeer, <var>NAMES.join(", ")</var>, in a single-file line to pull your sleigh. However,
                    <var>PAIR[0]</var> and <var>PAIR[1]</var> are <var>FIGHTING ? "fighting" : "best friends"</var>, so you have to
                    <var>FIGHTING ? "keep them apart" : "put them next to each other"</var>, or they won't fly.</p>
                <p class="question">How many ways can you arrange your reindeer?</p>
                <p class="solution" data-forms="integer"><var>ANSWER</var></p>

                <div class="hints">
                    <div>
                        <p>Forget about the reindeer that <var>FIGHTING ? "can't be" : "have to be"</var> together for a second, and let's try and
                        figure out how many ways we can arrange the reindeer if we don't have to worry about that.</p>
                        <p>We can build our line of reindeer one by one: there are <var>NAMES.length</var> slots, and we have <var>NAMES.length</var>
                        different reindeer we can put in the first slot.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Once we fill the first slot, we only have <var>NAMES.length-1</var> reindeer left, so we only have <var>NAMES.length-1</var>
                        choices for the second slot. So far, there are <code><var>NAMES.length</var>*<var>NAMES.length-1</var> = <var>NAMES.length*(NAMES.length-1)</var></code> unique choices we can make.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can continue in this way for the third reindeer, then the fourth, and so on, until we reach the last slot, where we only have
                        one reindeer left and so we can only make one choice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, the total number of unique choices we could make to get to an arrangement of reindeer is <code><var>_.map(_.range(NAMES.length).reverse(), function(l){ return (++l) + "*";}).join("").substring(0, NAMES.length*2-1)</var> = <var>factorial(NAMES.length)</var>.</code> Another way of writing this is <code><var>NAMES.length</var>!</code>, 
                        or <var>NAMES.length</var> factorial. But we haven't thought about the two reindeer who <var>FIGHTING ? "can't be together" : "have to be together"</var> yet.
                    </p>
                    <div data-if="FIGHTING" data-unwrap>
                        <p>
                            There are <var>factorial(NAMES.length)</var> different arrangements of reindeer altogether, so we just need to subtract
                            all the arrangements where <var>PAIR[0]</var> and <var>PAIR[1]</var> are together. How many of these are there?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We can count the number of arrangements where <var>PAIR[0]</var> and <var>PAIR[1]</var> are together by treating them as one double-reindeer. Now we can use the same idea as before to come up with <code><var>_.map(_.range(NAMES.length-1).reverse(), function(l){ return (++l) + "*";}).join("").substring(0, (NAMES.length-1)*2-1)</var> = <var>factorial(NAMES.length-1)</var></code> different arrangements. But that's not quite right.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Why? Because you can arrange the double-reindeer with <var>PAIR[0]</var> in front or with
                            <var>PAIR[1]</var> in front, and those are different arrangements! So the actual number of arrangements with <var>PAIR[0]</var>
                            and <var>PAIR[1]</var> together is <code><var>factorial(NAMES.length-1)</var>*2 = <var>factorial(NAMES.length-1)*2</var></code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, subtracting the number of arrangements where <var>PAIR[0]</var> and <var>PAIR[1]</var> are together from the total number
                            of arrangements, we get <var>ANSWER</var> arrangements of reindeer where they will fly.
                        </p>

                    <div data-else>
                        <p>
                            We can count the number of arrangements where <var>PAIR[0]</var> and <var>PAIR[1]</var> are together by treating them as one double-reindeer. Now we can use the same idea as before to come up with <code><var>_.map(_.range(NAMES.length-1).reverse(), function(l){ return (++l) + "*";}).join("").substring(0, (NAMES.length-1)*2-1)</var> = <var>factorial(NAMES.length-1)</var></code> different arrangements. But that's not quite right.

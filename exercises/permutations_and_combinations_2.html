                <div class="hints">
                    <div>
                        <p>Let's try building the arrangements (or permutations) letter by letter. The word is <code><var>WORD.length</var></code>
                        letters long:</p>
                        <p><var>_.map(_.range(WORD.length), function(l){ return "_ "; }).join("")</var></p>
                        <p>Now, for the first blank, we have <code><var>WORD.length</var></code> choices of letters to put in.
                    </p></div>
                    <div>
                        <p>After we put in the first letter, let's say it's <var>PERM[0]</var>, we have <code><var>WORD.length-1</var></code> blanks left.</p>
                        <p><var>PERM[0]+" "+_.map(_.range(WORD.length-1), function(l){ return "_ "; }).join("")</var></p>
                        <p>For the second blank, we only have <code><var>WORD.length-1</var></code> choices of letters left to put in. So far, there were
                            <code><var>WORD.length</var> \cdot <var>WORD.length-1</var></code> unique choices we could have made.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>We can continue in this fashion to put in a third letter, then a fourth, and so on. At each step, we have one fewer choice to
                        make, until we get to the last letter, and there's only one we can put in.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Using this method, the total number of arrangements is <code><var>_.map(_.range(WORD.length).reverse(), function(l){ return (++l);}).join("\\cdot")</var> = <var>factorial(WORD.length)</var>.</code> Another way of writing this is <code><var>WORD.length</var>!</code>, 
                        or <code><var>WORD.length</var></code> factorial, but this isn't quite the right answer.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Using the above method, we assumed that all the letters were unique. But they're not! There are <code><var>REPTIMES</var></code>
                        <var>REPLETTER</var>s, so we're counting every permutation multiple times. So every time we have these 
                        <code><var>factorial(REPTIMES)</var></code> permutations:</p>
                            <p>
                                <var>PERM_UNIQUE.join("&lt;/br&gt;")</var>
                            </p>
                        <p>We actually should have only one permutation:</p>
                            <p>
                                <var>PERM</var>
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Notice that we've overcounted our arrangements by <code><var>REPTIMES</var>!</code>. This is not a coincidence!
                        This is exactly the number of ways to permute <code><var>REPTIMES</var></code> objects, which we were doing with the
                        non-unique <var>REPLETTER</var>s. To address this overcounting, we need to divide the number of arrangements we counted
                        before by <code><var>REPTIMES</var>!</code>.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        When we divide the number of permutations we got by the number of times we're overcounting each permutation, we get
                        <code> \dfrac{<var>WORD.length</var>!}{<var>REPTIMES</var>!} = \dfrac{<var>factorial(WORD.length)</var>}{<var>factorial(REPTIMES)</var>} = <var>ANSWER</var></code>

                        <p>We can build our line of reindeer one by one: there are <code><var>NAMES.length</var></code> slots,

                        choices for the second slot. So far, there are <code><var>NAMES.length</var> \cdot <var>NAMES.length-1</var> = <var>NAMES.length*(NAMES.length-1)</var></code> unique choices we can make.

                        We can continue in this way for the third reindeer, then the fourth, and so on, until we reach the last slot, where we only have

                            There are <code><var>factorial(NAMES.length)</var></code> different arrangements of reindeer altogether, 
                            so we just need to subtract

                            Why? Because you can arrange the double-reindeer with <var>PAIR[0]</var> in front or with
                            <var>PAIR[1]</var> in front, and those are different arrangements! So the actual number of arrangements with <var>PAIR[0]</var>
                            and <var>PAIR[1]</var> together is <code><var>factorial(NAMES.length-1)</var> \cdot 2 =

                                Using similar logic for the second factor, take <code> \dfrac{100}{<var>FAC2</var>}</code>, which is between <code><var>
                                FAC2_TIMES</var></code> and <code><var>FAC2_TIMES+1</var></code>. So, starting at <code>0</code> and adding <code><var>FAC2</var></code>
                                at each step, you have to take between <code><var>FAC2_TIMES</var></code> and <code><var>FAC2_TIMES+1</var></code> steps to get
                                to <code>100</code>. Since if you take a fraction of a step you won't get to a number divisible by <code><var>FAC2</var></code>,
                                you'll hit <code><var>FAC2_TIMES</var></code> numbers divisible by <code><var>FAC2</var></code> before you get to above <code>100</code>.
                                So, there are <code><var>FAC2_TIMES</var></code> numbers between <code>1</code> and <code>100</code> divisible by <code><var>FAC2</var></code>.

                    <p>
                        So, you might think there are <code><var>FAC1_TIMES</var> + <var>FAC2_TIMES</var> = <var>FAC1_TIMES+FAC2_TIMES</var></code> 
                        numbers divisible by one or the other, but this is overcounting something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We're counting every number which is divisible by both <code><var>FAC1</var></code> and <code><var>FAC2</var></code> twice.
                        So, for example, <code><var>FAC1*FAC2</var></code> is counted once as a number divisible by <code><var>FAC1</var></code>, and then again as a number divisible by <code><var>FAC2</var></code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, we need to count how many numbers are divisible by both <code><var>FAC1</var></code> and <code><var>FAC2</var></code>
                        and subtract this from what we had before.

                        Being divisible by both <code><var>FAC1</var></code> and <code><var>FAC2</var></code> is the same thing as being divisible by

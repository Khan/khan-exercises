			<div class="hints">
				<p>The average velocity is the displacement vector divided by the  time.</p>
				<p>The displacement north is a vector and is equal to the distance <var>person(1)</var> travels north minus the distance <var>he(1)</var> travels south, because the vectors are in opposite directions.</p>
				
				<p> The displacement south is <code><var>TIME2</var> \text{h} \times <var>SCORES2</var> \text{km/h} = <var>TIME2 * SCORES2</var> \text{km}</code>.</p>
				<p> Therefore the total displacement north is <code><var>SUM1</var>\text{km (north)} - <var>SUM2</var>\text{km (south)} = <var>SUM</var> \text{km (north)} </code> </p>
				<p> The total time is the sum of the times <var>he(1)</var> travels north and south and is equal to <code><var>TIME1</var> + <var>TIME2</var> = <var>TIME1 + TIME2</var></code>  </p>
				<p> Therefore the average velocity north is equal to <code><var>SUM</var> \div <var>TIME1 + TIME2</var> = <var>SUM / (TIME1 + TIME2)</var></code> </p>

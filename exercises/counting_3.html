			<div class="question">
				<p>You've been transported to the world of Harry Potter. You are leading a magical expedition with a group of 4 students from Hogwarts.</p>
				<p><var>GRYFF</var> students from the house of Gryffindor, <var>SLYTH</var> from Slytherin, <var>HUFFLE</var> from Hufflepuff, and <var>RAVEN</var> from Ravenclaw applied to join your team. Group members are chosen randomly.</p>	
				<p>How many different groups can be formed?</p>

		<div>
			<p><strong>Hint #1:</strong><br>
			Let&#39;s change the problem to make it more simple. <br> <br>
			You are leading  a group of <strong>2 students</strong> from Hogwarts. Pretend Harry and Hermoine from Gryffindor, and Draco from Slytherin are applying. How many different groups can be formed? Let&#39;s write out all the possible groups. <br>
				<ul>
				<li>Harry and Hermoine</li>
				<li>Harry and Draco</li>
				<li>Hermoine and Draco</li>
				</ul><br>
			There are 3 different groups you can form. Notice how we did not count both
			Harry and Hermione <strong>and</strong> Hermione and Harry. Is there a technique that can help you count the different groups when you don&#39;t care about order?
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<strong>Hint #2:</strong><br>
			The combination formula will calculate the different ways of selecting a group of things when order does not matter. The formula for a combination is:<br><br> 
			<strong>nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!</strong><br><br> 			
			
			In our simple problem from Hint #1, the n is 3 and the r is 2. There are 3 people applying and you want to grab 2 people as part of your group.<br> 
			
			How can we apply that same technique to the original problem now? 
		</div>
		<div>
			<p><strong>Hint #3:</strong><br>
			We need to count the total number of people applying to be our n.<br>
			This is <var>GRYFF</var> + <var>SLYTH</var> + <var>HUFFLE</var> + <var>RAVEN</var>. <br>
			There are <var>APPLICANTS</var> people applying and you want to grab 4 people so the answer is (<var>APPLICANTS</var> choose 4).</p>

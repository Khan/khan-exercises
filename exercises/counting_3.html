					<strong>Hint #1: Have you seen the <a class="related-video" href="/video/permutations?playlist=Precalculus" data-youtube-id="XqQTXW7XfYA">Permutations</a> video?</strong><br>
					In the video, Sal reviews an example where you seat 7 students in 3 chairs. 
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong>Hint #2: How many chairs do we have?</strong><br>
					In this problem we need to seat all <var> NUM_STUDENTS </var> students. To seat all the students we must have <var> NUM_STUDENTS </var> chairs. <br> <br>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong>Hint #3: How many students can sit in the first chair?</strong><br>
					In the first chair, we have <var> NUM_STUDENTS </var> students.
					In the second chair, we have <var> NUM_STUDENTS </var> - 1 students remaining to sit in the chair. <br>
					If we say there are N students in total, our formula for solving the number of seating arrangements for the first two chairs is: <br> <br>
					
					N*(N-1)
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong>Hint #4: To calculate all possible seating arrangements, use the factorial formula.</strong><br>
					There are <var> NUM_STUDENTS </var> factorial seating arrangements. <var> NUM_STUDENTS </var>! is  <var>SEATING_ARRANGEMENTS</var>.

				<p>You've been transported to the world of Harry Potter. You are leading a magical expedition with a group of 4 students from Hogwarts.</p>
				<p>There are <var>APPLICANTS</var> students applying. Any of the applicants can be chosen in your group.</p>	
				<p>How many different groups can be formed?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="solution"><var>NUM_GROUPS</var></div>
			<div class="hints">
				<div>
					<p><strong>Hint #1: When you count the different groups, Order does NOT matter! This is a combination problem</strong><br>
					The combination formula will calculate the different ways of selecting a group of items when order does not matter. The formula for a combination is:<br><br> 
					<strong><code>\dbinom{N}{R} =  _NC_R = \dfrac{N!}{R!*(N-R)!}</code></strong><br><br>  			
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong>Hint #2: What is the N in this problem? What is the R in this problem?</strong><br>
					N is equal to <var> APPLICANTS</var> student applicants. <br>
					R is equal to the 4 people you are choosing. Calculate: <br><br>
					<code>\dbinom{<var>APPLICANTS</var>}{4} = \dfrac{<var>APPLICANTS</var>!}{4!*(<var>APPLICANTS</var>-4)!}</code>

			<div class="question">
				<p>You've been transported to the world of Harry Potter. You are leading a magical expedition with a group of 4 students from Hogwarts.</p>
				<p><var>GRYFF</var> students from the house of Gryffindor, <var>SLYTH</var> from Slytherin, <var>HUFFLE</var> from Hufflepuff, and <var>RAVEN</var> from Ravenclaw applied to join your team. Any of the applicants can be chosen in your group.</p>	
				<p>How many different groups can be formed?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="solution"><var>NUM_GROUPS</var></div>
			<div class="hints">
				<div>
					<p><strong>Hint #1: When you count the different groups, Order does NOT matter!</strong><br> <br>
					As an example, let&#39;s change the problem to make it more simple. 
					You are leading  a group of <strong>2 students</strong> from Hogwarts. Pretend Harry, Hermoine, and Draco are applying. How many different groups can be formed? Write out all the possible groups. <br>
						<ul>
						<li>Harry and Hermoine</li>
						<li>Harry and Draco</li>
						<li>Hermoine and Draco</li>
						</ul><br>
					There are 3 different groups you can form. <br><br>
					<strong>Notice how we did not count both </strong><br>
						<ul>
						<li>Harry and Hermione </li>
						<li>and </li> 
						<li>Hermione and Harry</li> <br>
						</ul>
						<strong>Is there a technique that can help you count the different groups when you don&#39;t care about order?</strong>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<strong>Hint #2: This is a combination problem</strong><br><br>
					The combination formula will calculate the different ways of selecting a group of items when order does not matter. The formula for a combination is:<br><br>
					 
					<strong><code>\dbinom{N}{R} =  _NC_R = \dfrac{N!}{R!*(N-R)!}</code></strong><br><br> 			
					
					In our simple problem from Hint #1, the N is 3 and the R is 2. There are 3 people applying and you want 2 people as part of your group.<br> 
					
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong>Hint #3: What is the N and R for the original problem? </strong><br>
					We need to count the total number of students applying to be our N.<br>
					The N is <var>GRYFF</var> + <var>SLYTH</var> + <var>HUFFLE</var> + <var>RAVEN</var>. <br>
					There are <var>APPLICANTS</var> students applying and you want 4 students so the answer is 
					<code>\dbinom{<var>APPLICANTS</var>}{4} = \dfrac{<var>APPLICANTS</var>!}{4!*(<var>APPLICANTS</var>-4)!}</code></p>

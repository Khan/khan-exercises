				<p>You've been transported to the world of Harry Potter. You are leading a magical expedition with a group of 4 students from Hogwarts.</p>
				<p><var>GRYFF</var> students from the house of Gryffindor, <var>SLYTH</var> from Slytherin, <var>HUFFLE</var> from Hufflepuff, and <var>RAVEN</var> from Ravenclaw applied to join your team. Any of the applicants can be chosen in your group.</p>	
				<p>How many different groups can be formed?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="solution"><var>NUM_GROUPS</var></div>
			<div class="hints">
				<div>
					<p><strong>Hint #1:</strong><br>
					Let&#39;s change the problem to make it more simple. <br> <br>
					You are leading  a group of <strong>2 students</strong> from Hogwarts. Pretend Harry and Hermoine from Gryffindor, and Draco from Slytherin are applying. How many different groups can be formed? Let&#39;s write out all the possible groups. <br>
						<ul>
						<li>Harry and Hermoine</li>
						<li>Harry and Draco</li>
						<li>Hermoine and Draco</li>
						</ul><br>
					There are 3 different groups you can form. Notice how we did not count both
					Harry and Hermione <strong>and</strong> Hermione and Harry. Is there a technique that can help you count the different groups when you don&#39;t care about order?
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<strong>Hint #2:</strong><br>
					The combination formula will calculate the different ways of selecting a group of things when order does not matter. The formula for a combination is:<br><br> 
					<strong>nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!</strong><br><br> 			
					
					In our simple problem from Hint #1, the n is 3 and the r is 2. There are 3 people applying and you want to grab 2 people as part of your group.<br> 
					
					How can we apply that same technique to the original problem now? 
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong>Hint #3:</strong><br>
					We need to count the total number of people applying to be our n.<br>
					This is <var>GRYFF</var> + <var>SLYTH</var> + <var>HUFFLE</var> + <var>RAVEN</var>. <br>
					There are <var>APPLICANTS</var> people applying and you want to grab 4 people so the answer is (<var>APPLICANTS</var> choose 4).</p>

			<div class="question">
				<p>There are <var>NUM_STUDENTS</var> students to be seated in a row. How many different seating arrangements is possible? </p>
				
			</div>
			<div class="solution"><var>SEATING_ARRANGEMENTS</var></div>
			<div class="hints">
				
				<div>
					<strong>Hint #1:</strong><br>
					Watch the video <a class="related-video" href="/video/permutations?playlist=Precalculus" data-youtube-id="XqQTXW7XfYA">Permutations</a>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong>Hint #2:</strong><br>
					In the video example, there are 7 students in 3 chairs. In this problem we need to seat all the students. To seat all the students we must have <var> NUM_STUDENTS </var> chairs. <br> <br>
					In the first chair, we can have <var> NUM_STUDENTS </var> students.
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong>Hint #3:</strong><br>
					In the second chair, we have <var> NUM_STUDENTS </var> - 1 students remaining to sit in the chair. <br>
					If we say there are n students in total, so far our formula for solving the number of seating arrangements for the first two chairs is: <br> <br>
					
					n*(n-1)
				</div>
				<div>
					<p><strong>Hint #4:</strong><br>
					To calculate all possible seating arrangements, use the factorial formula. There are <var> NUM_STUDENTS </var> factorial seating arrangements.

                A game at the carnival offers these odds: you get to roll a 
                ten-sided die, and if you roll <var>RESULT_DESC</var>,
                you make <code><var>MAKE</var></code> dollars. Unfortunately, 
                if you roll anything else, you lose 
                <code><var>LOSE</var></code> dollars.
            </p>

            <p class="question">
                How much money do you expect to make (or lose) 
                playing this game?

                    The expected value of an event (like playing this game)
                    is the average of the values of each outcome. Since some
                    outcomes are more likely than others (sometimes), we
                    weight the value of each outcome according to its
                    probability to get an accurate idea of what value
                    to expect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two events that can happen in this game: either
                    you roll <var>RESULT_DESC</var>, or you don't. So, the
                    expected value will look like this:
                    <br><br>
                    <code>E = </code>
                    (money gained when you roll <var>RESULT_DESC</var>) 
                    <code>\cdot</code>
                    (probability of rolling <var>RESULT_DESC</var>)
                    <code>+</code>
                    (money gained when you don't roll <var>RESULT_DESC</var>)
                    <code>\cdot</code>
                    (probability of not rolling <var>RESULT_DESC</var>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The money you gain when you win
                    is <code>$<var>MAKE</var></code>.
                    The probability of winning is the probability
                    that you roll <var>RESULT_DESC</var>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This probability is the number of winning outcomes
                    divided by the total number of
                    outcomes, <code><var>MAKE_FR</var></code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The money you gain when you lose is
                    <code>-$<var>LOSE</var></code>
                    (since you actually lose money). The probability that 
                    you lose is the probability that you don't roll 
                    <var>RESULT_DESC</var>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This probability must be
                    <code>1 - <var>MAKE_FR</var> = <var>LOSE_FR</var></code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, if we take the average of the amount of money you make
                    on each outcome, weighted by how probable each outcome is,
                    we get the expected amount of money you will make: 
                    <code>(<var>MAKE</var>\cdot<var>MAKE_FR</var>) +
                        (-<var>LOSE</var>\cdot<var>LOSE_FR</var>) =
                        <var>ANS_F</var> = <span data-if="ANS < 0">-$<var>-ANS</var></span>
                        <span data-else="">$<var>ANS</var></span>.

                    The expected value of an event (like rolling a die)
                    is the average of the values of each outcome. To get an

                    weight the value of each outcome according to its
                    probability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case, there are <var>SIDES</var> outcomes:
                    the first outcome is rolling a 1, the second outcome is
                    rolling a 2, and so on. The value of each of these outcomes
                    is just the number you roll.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, the value of the first outcome is 1, and its
                    probability is <code>\dfrac{1}{<var>SIDES</var>}</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The value of the second outcome is 2, the value of
                    the third outcome is 3, and so on. There are 
                    <var>SIDES</var> outcomes altogether, and each of them
                    occurs with probability

                </p>
                <p>
                    So, if we average the values of each of these outcomes,

                You decide you're only going to buy a lottery ticket if the

                    The expected value of an event (like buying a lottery
                    ticket) is the average of the values of each outcome. 
                    In this case, the outcome where you win is much less likely
                    than the outcome that you lose. So, to get an accurate idea
                    of how much money you expect to win or lose, we have to
                    take an average weighted by the probability of each outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an equation, this means the expected amount of money
                    you will win is
                    <code>E = </code> (money gained when you win)

                <p>
                    Let's figure out each of these terms one at a time. The
                    money you gain when you win is your winnings minus the 
                    cost of the ticket, <code>$<var>PRIZE</var> - 
                    $<var>COST</var></code> (you may find the math easier
                    if you <b>don't</b> simplify this).
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the question, we know the probability of winning is 
                    <code><var>ODD_F</var></code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The money you gain when you lose is actually negative,
                    and is just the cost of the ticket,
                    <code>-$<var>COST</var></code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the probability of losing is <code>(1 - 
                    <var>ODD_F</var>)</code> (you may find the math
                    easier if you <b>don't</b> simplify this).

                <p>
                    Putting it all together, the expected value is
